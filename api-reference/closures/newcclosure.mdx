description: "Converts a closure into a C closure."

```lua
newcclosure(f: function): function
```
If `f` is already a C closure it will just return the same function.

## Example

```lua
function test() end
iscclosure(test) -- outputs: false

local ctest = newcclosure(test)
iscclosure(ctest) -- outputs: true
```

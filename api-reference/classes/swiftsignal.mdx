title: "Class: SwiftSignal"
---

```lua
Signal.new(f: function?): SwiftSignal, SwiftConnection?
```

Creates and returns a `SwiftSignal`. If a function `f` is provided, it also creates a [SwiftConnection](./swiftconnection) and returns it along with the signal.

```lua
Signal:Connect(f: function): SwiftConnection
```
Connects a function `f` to the Signal when the signal is fired, the function will execute.

```lua
Signal:Fire(...: any): void
```
Fires all connections connected to the signal (if the connectons are enabled) with the provided paramaters (`...`).

```lua
Signal:Delete(): void
```
Deletes the connection.

## Examples

### Creating a signal without providing a function

```lua
local signal = Signal.new()

local connection = signal:Connect(function(arg) 
    print(arg)
end)

signal:Fire("Hello",1,{}) -- outputs: "Hello" (from the connection)
```

### Same example but providing a function

```lua
local signal, connection = Signal.new(function(arg) 
    print(arg)
end)

signal:Fire("Hello",1,{}) -- outputs: "Hello" (from the connection)
```

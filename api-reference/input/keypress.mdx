```lua
keypress(keycode: number): void
```
Simulates a key press **only** if the roblox window is focused. Note that a key press is distinct from a key click, as you will need to release the key separately. The `keycode` corresponds to [virtual key codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).

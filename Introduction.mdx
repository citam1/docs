This documentation covers all the custom functions available in Swift.
<Warning>The Swift documentation is currently a work in progress. All custom functions may not be documented.</Warning>


## Guide to Documentation
Lets take function `fireclickdetector` for an example.
```lua
fireclickdetector(p1: Instance<ClickDetector>, distance: number?): void
```

This structure serves as the foundation for all function definitions in the documentation.

First we have the function name, in this case `fireclickdetector`.
Next, anything enclosed within the parentheses `(` and `)` represents the parameters of the function.

### Paramaters

Paramaters are values that you pass into the function.
Lets take a look at some parameters and types.

In this case we have 2 paramaters `p1` and `distance`.
We can also see their types.

* `p1` is of type of Instance, and specifically an Instance of the class `ClickDetector` (denoted by the `<` and `>`)

* `distance` is of type number, which in Lua can represent either a float (double) or an integer. Additionally, the `?` after the type declaration indicates that the parameter is optional.

### Return value
We can see that `fireclickdetector` returns `void`, which means it doesn't return any value. The return type is declared after the closing parentheses.

Thatâ€™s basically it! You can now continue exploring more functions in the [API Referance](/api-reference).

**Have fun exploiting!**

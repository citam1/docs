description: "Creates a new special C closure with a secure environment."

```lua
newsecureclosure(f: function, tbl: table?): function
```
Creates a new C Closure that runs at the thread identity `2`, [setthreadidentity](../environment/setthreadidentity) in the closure is **disabled**. All hooks are disabled and the whole environment is removed.

You can specify custom function names in the `tbl` table, making those functions available within the secure closure.

This table should contain **only** the names of functions that you want to **allow** access to in the secure environment. If `tbl` is omitted, the secure closure will be created without access to any additional functions.

If `f` is already a C closure it will throw an error.

<Warning>Remember, any functions you allow in the closure can be detected by Roblox's anti-cheat system, which might check if they exist. Furthermore HttpGet will NOT be available, use request.</Warning>
## Examples


### Creating a secure closure without providing any functions.
```lua
local secureclosure = newsecureclosure(function()
    print(getgenv) -- outputs: nil
    print(game.Players) -- outputs: Players
end)

secureclosure()
```

### Creating a secure closure with custom functions.
```lua
local secureclosure = newsecureclosure(function()
    print(getgenv()) -- outputs: table: 0x??????
    print(game.Players) -- outputs: Players
    print(identifyexecutor())  -- outputs: "Swift" "0.0.0"
end, {"getgenv","identifyexecutor"})

secureclosure()
```

### Hooking with secure closures
```lua
local old;
old = hookmetamethod(game,"__namecall",newsecureclosure(function(self,...) 

    local namemethod = getnamecallmethod()

    if nameMethod == "FireServer" and game.IsA(self, "RemoteEvent") then
        if self.Name == "FallRemote" then
            return;
        end
    end
    
    return old(self,...)
end), {"getnamecallmethod"})
```
